# Unmaintainable release policy, removal on 2022-12-31.
#
# Upstream maintainers decided on a release policy that has
# become unmaintainable for me, since I cannot distinguish if
# a release contains untested code or not. So I decided that
# I no longer maintain this package for Gentoo.
#
# See: https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/issues/3853
#
# As an alternative feel free to have a look at sys-boot/rpi-imager
